# `pyCEC` ‚Äì Python HDMI-CEC Bridge for Kodi & Home Assistant

The purpose of this project is:

üîπ to provide an object-based API to [libcec](https://github.com/Pulse-Eight/libcec)  for the [
`hdmi_cec`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/hdmi_cec/) module in **Home Assistant
** ([primary goal](https://github.com/konikvranik/pyCEC/projects/1))  
üîπ to offer a TCP ‚áÑ HDMI bridge to control CEC devices over
network  ([secondary goal](https://github.com/konikvranik/pyCEC/projects/2))

---

## ‚ú® Features

üîå Send commands to your TV or AV receiver  
üñ•Ô∏è Monitor HDMI power and input status  
üè† Integrate with Home Assistant automations  
üéÆ Control devices using Kodi remote or custom scripts  
üíª Simple command-line interface (CLI)  
üêç Python API for custom scripting  
üì∫ Kodi integration (via bundled plugin)

---

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install pyCEC
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **libcec must be installed** for direct-mode usage.  
> Do **not** run `pip install cec` ‚Äì it will fail.
> Instead, [compile libcec](https://github.com/Pulse-Eight/libcec#supported-platforms) for your OS.

### On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install libcec-dev cec-utils
```

If you're using a **Python virtualenv**, make sure it can access system Python modules with:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv --system-site-packages
```

> üí° **Note:** When using `pyCEC` in *network mode* (TCP client), `libcec` is **not required**.

---

## üöÄ Running the Server

You can launch the server bridge with:

```bash
python3 -m pycec
```

This binds to TCP port `9526` on all interfaces.

Then:

- connect from a remote `pyCEC` client using `TcpAdapter`
- or use [Netcat](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netcat) to manually send CEC commands:

```bash
echo '10:04' | nc YOUR_IP 9526
```

---

## üè† Home Assistant Integration (Multiple TVs via Telnet)

You can integrate `pyCEC` into Home Assistant via `telnet` platform, for example:

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: telnet
    switches:
      some_device_id:
        name: "Some Device Name"
        resource: 192.168.1.123
        port: 9526
        command_on: '10:04'
        command_off: '10:36'
        command_state: '10:8f'
        value_template: '{{ value == "01:90:00" }}'
        timeout: 1
```

This allows you to switch devices on/off or query their state.
